TS is an enhanced version of javascript.
We could say it a superset of javascript.
You can understand like C++ is an enhanced version of C language.
Typescript is build on avascript.
TS is not a new language.This is just adding some new features in js.
But TS cannot run on the browser directly as TS compiler convert the code from Typescript to javascript
Check Error on Compile Time
Add type like strings, number, bool etc.
Code is well managed
